<!-- rc scout is an internal tool that helps rc log and track metrics on how users found your project / link + link to recurse.com -->
<!-- https://github.com/recursecenter/wiki/wiki/RC-Scout -->
<!--
The only two events Scout logs are script loads and link clicks, both on a per-token basis. For each event, the user data we record is limited to:

IP address
referrer, if any
Scout token, if one is present in the query string
user agent
RC unique ID, if the user is a Recurser and logged in to recurse.com
With this info, we can also tie your links to browsing sessions on recurse.com, and know with some certainty if a person you referred eventually submits an RC application.

Scout doesn't set tracking cookies or parse any of your site's content.

Second Stint @ RC. Projects, Notes + Blog

## Setup

I'm doing a half batch (6-weeks) at [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com). This will be my second time participating in a batch at RC. My first batch was W2 2016.

At this point in my career, I was in the process of transitioning from a non-techincal project manager to getting my first real job as a software engineer.

I've worked as a programmer since '17.
